## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: Can I import data from another property management system?

**A:** Not directly in v1.0.0. You'll need to manually enter your properties, tenants, and leases. Data import features are planned for a future release.

### Q: What happens when I reach the 9-property limit?

**A:** When you try to add a 10th property, you'll see an upgrade message explaining that Nine is limited to 9 properties. You can either:

- Remove an inactive property to add a new one
- Upgrade to Nine Professional (future release) for unlimited properties

### Q: Can I have more than 3 users?

**A:** No, Nine is limited to 3 users (1 system account + 2 login users). This is a product-level restriction. For more users, you'll need to upgrade to Nine Professional when available.

### Q: Is my data stored in the cloud?

**A:** No, Nine stores all data **locally on your computer** in a SQLite database file. Your data never leaves your device unless you choose to enable email/SMS notifications or back up to a cloud service.

### Q: Do I need internet access?

**A:** **No** for core features - the application works completely offline. **Yes** for optional features:

- Email notifications (SendGrid)
- SMS notifications (Twilio)
- Future online payment processing

### Q: How do I back up my data?

**A:** Navigate to **Settings** → **Database** → **Backup & Restore**:

- Click **"Create Backup"** for manual backup (recommended before major changes)
- Enable **"Schedule Automatic Backups"** for daily/weekly backups
- Backups stored in: `Data/Backups/` folder
- Copy backups to external drive or cloud storage for safety

### Q: What if I accidentally delete something?

**A:** Nine uses **soft delete** - deleted records are marked as deleted but not permanently removed. Contact support for data recovery assistance if needed.

### Q: Can I run this on a Mac?

**A:** Not in v1.0.0. macOS support is planned for a future release. For now, use a Windows or Linux computer.

### Q: Is there a mobile app?

**A:** Not yet. A mobile companion app (view-only) is planned for a future release.
